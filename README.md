# Kmap-Solver (Java)
The Kmap Solver is a tool that solves boolean algebra equations. 

This Kmap Solver was created by Dominick Lamastra [TCNJ 2023]. The Quine McCluskey algorithm was used to find the minimal sum of products. This tool was created to support the CSC 325 Computer Architecture course at The College of New Jersey and can be used by others to learn more about Karnaugh Maps.
